# Intro to JavaScript

# What _is_ JavaScript

In short, Javascript is a programming language that we use to add interactivity to websites. Interactivity is a very broad term here: it could involve clicking a button to show some text, get data from an external source, or involve rendering a video game on a website!

Today, we'll talk about the core application of Javascript (in the browser, manipulating the DOM); later, we'll discuss things like React and Node.

## Hello World

First, how can we even run Javascript? For now, we're going to restrict ourselves to our browser.

Let's open up an HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>we're going to learn JS!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I'm so excited to learn Javascript!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

We can add Javascript by using the `<script>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>we're going to learn JS!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I'm so excited to learn Javascript!</p>
    <script>
      // some Javascript can go here!!
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Cool! We haven't rendered anything to the page yet, but we have learned our first piece of Javascript: you can use `//` to comment (and as you might expect, `/* */` to block comment).

This is pretty inconvenient though, because we're going to have all of our HTML and JS in this one mega-file. Let's modularize a bit:

```html
<!-- sample.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>we're going to learn JS!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I'm so excited to learn Javascript!</p>
    <script src="sample.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, let's make our `sample.js` file, and do our customary hello world.

```js
// sample.js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

If you go to your page, it'll look like nothing has happened. But, we need to look a little closer. Go to your browser's console (usually from the Dev Tools, or "Inspect Element"):

Would you look at that! We did it!

But first, exactly _what_ did we do? Let's break down our code a little bit, and learn some more about JS.

```js
// sample.js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

There are actually quite a few details we can learn about the language:

- `"Hello World!"` is a string, so Javascript supports strings!
- `console.log()` looks like a function, and the `.` implies some sort of object-based properties
- there are semicolons! (it turns out, these are optional. maybe more on that in a bit)
- Javascript seems imperative and sequential! if you don't know what that means, no worries.

If you've programmed in languages like C++, Java, or Python, this will all sound familiar to you. And that's great! Many of the basic syntax rules that Javascript has are very C-like.

One other thing: you'll note that we didn't have to do any compiling. That's because Javascript is _interpreted_. More on that later.

## Variables and Types in Javascript

First, how do variables work in Javascript? It turns out, that's a more complicated question than you might think. Here's a basic hello world, with variables:

```js
// sample.js
let helloStr = "Hello World!";
console.log(helloStr);
```

That wasn't too hard! `let` is the default variable keyword that we're going to use. This is inspired from Lisp, if you were wondering.

But hold on. We didn't say anything about the type of helloStr. If your background is in statically-typed languages, this should ring an alarm. How does the interpreter know what type `helloStr` is?

The answer is that Javascript is **dynamically typed**. In other words, the type of a variable, an expression, or the return value of a function, all of these things are **evaluated at runtime**. If your interpreted background is Python, this is the same behaviour you'd expect; if your favourite interpreted language is OCaml, you're probably pretty sad.

However, a language being dynamically typed is not the same thing as saying that it has no types. Javascript still has types, and in fact, a good understanding of these types is very important!

### Primitive Types

Javascript has 7 "primitive" types, which technically means that they are **immutable**.

The primitive types are:

- `Boolean` (`true` or `false`)
- `Number` (spec'd as a 64-bit float)
- `String` (uncommon to languages)
- `BigInt` (arbitrary-precision number)
- `Undefined` (special)
- `Null` (special)
- `Symbol` (new, and out-of-scope of this lecture)

Here are some examples:

```js
console.log(true);
console.log(false);
console.log(42);
console.log("hello world");
console.log(
  12342942374982342342342323423423423234234234234234223423423423423423423423423423
);
console.log(undefined);
console.log(null);
// Symbol is out of scope :(
```

Some of these are familiar: almost every language has `Boolean` (except C, I'm looking at you). It's convenient that Javascript supports strings out of the box (C, I'm looking at you again).

There are some noticeable missing entries. Javascript doesn't have C-like `int`, `short`, `double`, or other types of integer/float precision: it's just floating point. This leads to some fun shenanigans:

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
// 0.30000000000000004
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);
// false
```

(implicitly, we've also learned here that `+` works with numbers in the way you might expect, and you can use `==` to perform an equality check)

Javascript also doesn't have `char` or some equivalent (but that's not a huge deal, string-everything is ok). And finally, we'll notice that Javascript doesn't have an explicit pointer type - even though _references are a big deal_, and an understanding of references is important.

### Type Coercion

This is a good time to bring up type equality and coercion. **Type coercion** is the automatic conversion of types in certain operations. We'll spend some more time on this in a bit, but let us introduce what we mean:

```js
console.log(42 == "42");
// true
console.log(42 === "42");
// false

console.log("42" - 1);
// 41
console.log("42" + 1);
// "421"
```

Wow, that set of statements seems needlessly confusing.

- `==` is a **coercive** or **loose** equality. It tries to convert both items to the same type first.
- `===` is strict equality. It doesn't perform any coercion, and only is true if both sides are the same type and value.
- `-` only works with `Number` and `Number` on both sides; so, it'll convert everything to `Number` first.
- `+` is a little trickier! If the types aren't the same, it prefers string concatenation (weird, right), so it'll first try converting everything to a string. That _always works_, so we never explore the path where it's a number!

This brings the interesting question: what happens in this snippet?

```js
console.log(1 - "wow!");
// NaN
```

Like many other float conventions, Javascript has NaN - or **Not a Number**. This is a special value that you'll get if the computation doesn't make sense (e.g. a number minus a string). `NaN` propagates as well: `NaN` times anything is `NaN`, `NaN` subtracted by anything is `NaN`, etc.

Coercion also happens with booleans: values that are `0`, `null`,`undefined`, `""` (the empty string) and `NaN` are coerced to `false`, and the rest are `true`. Note that this coercion doesn't occur with `==`, since it doesn't require a boolean; we're more talking about conditionals (which we'll see soon)!

### Everything is an Object

It turns out, everything in Javascript is an _object_ - and we mean object in an _object-oriented_ programming way.

Let's take arrays, for example. Like many other programming languages, Javascript supports variable-length arrays (which are really more like lists).

```js
let arr = [1, 2, "cat", "dog"];
// yup, JS lets you have elements with different types in arrays

console.log(arr[2]);
// "cat"

console.log(arr.length);
// 4

arr.push("ðŸ¥º");
// ðŸ¥º - that's right, you can put emojis into arrays
// oh... the important thing being that arrays are mutable (unlike primitve types!)

console.log(arr);
// [1,2,"cat","dog","ðŸ¥º"]
```

That's right, this array was an object. Under the hood, when we called `let arr`, we "called the constructor for an array" (not... entirely true). Then, when we do things like `.length` or `.push()`, we're accessing variables or using class functions respectively!

This is the case for _every data type_ in Javascript, including the primitive ones we discussed earlier! They all stem from one "class" (not entirely true) called `Object`, which has a [wide variety of predefined properties and methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object). You'll probably find the `toString()` method helpful later on. This is very similar to how Java works.

Exactly how do objects work in Javascript? Well, they're **key-value** pairs. In fact, that makes the `Object` class itself very useful: it's a dictionary! If you've heard of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), this next syntax is going to be quite familiar:

```js
let dict = {
  key1: "hey there!",
  key2: "i'm an object!",
};

console.log(dict);
// Object {
//     key1: "hey there!",
//     key2: "i'm an object!"
// };

console.log(dict.key1);
// "hey there!"

dict["key1"] = "value1";
console.log(dict.key1);
// "value1"
```

Hopefully, this should look somewhat familiar to arrays, because arrays **are just a type of object**!

### let, var, and const

So far, we've discussed using the `let` keyword to define variables. `let` is block-scoped:

```js
if (error) {
  let errorMessage = "oh no!";
}
console.log(error);
// undefined
```

It only maintains its scope in the "block" that it was defined in, which is roughly the nearest set of braces. This is similar to how variable declarations work in almost any other language that you know.

There is another keyword, `var` - in fact, this is the original one. `var` is function scoped. We... haven't gone into functions yet, but the key difference is visible here:

```js
if (error) {
  var errorMessage = "oh no!";
}
console.log(error);
// "oh no!"
```

This rarely will affect you in your day-to-day coding life, but it's probably best practice to use `let` - it's the behaviour that most programmers expect. We'll go over `var` once we get to functions!

And finally, `const`? Well, it mostly behaves how you'd think:

```js
const DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS = 42;
DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS = 21;
// Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const CONSTANT_OBJECT = {};
CONSTANT_OBJECT["a"] = 42;
console.log(CONSTANT_OBJECT);
// {a : 42}

CONSTANT_OBJECT = {};
// Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

Okay, well that first example makes sense. But what's up with the second one? Well, recall that all data types in Javascript are objects, and therefore all variables are references.

So, what `const` really guarantees is that the reference will always stay the same. With primitive data types, that's great: because they're immutable, once the value is created, it'll never change. But, for every non-primitive data type, the object _is mutable_, and so it can change at any point without changing the underlying reference. Long story short? Using `const` on an object, or an array, or many other data types doesn't guarantee that it's truly constant - it just can't be reassigned.

## Quick Control Flow Stuffs

If you've programmed in a C-like language, control flow in Javascript is nothing new.

```js
let theAnswer = 42;
if (theAnswer === 42) {
  console.log("The answer to the everything is 42!");
} else if (theAnswer == 42) {
  console.log("LOL you don't know how types work in Javascript");
} else {
  console.log("So long, thanks for all the fish!");
}
// "The answer to the everything is 42!"

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

let hungry = true;
while (hungry) {
  goToBplate();
}
```

## Speaking of Functions...

Javascript is a **functional programming language**. By the sound of that, functions are probably pretty important. They look pretty C-like to us:

```js
function saySomething(message) {
  console.log(message);
}

saySomething("hey there!");
// "hey there!"

function squared(n) {
  return n ^ 2;
}

squared(2);
// 4
```

You start by writing the keyword `function`, then the name of the function, and inside the parentheses, each parameter. Finally, you've got the body, and either an explicit `return` statement, or an implicit empty return (`return;`).

Note that there are no explicit types here! This can actually make things quite confusing.

```js
function adder(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

adder(42, 42);
// 84
adder(42, "42");
// "4242"
```

## Manipulating the DOM

Okay, but how does this help us make websites? Well, the original focus was to change the "Document Object Model", which as you may recall, is a fancy word for our webpage. Let's run through a bare-bones example:

```html
<button id="button">click me!</button>
<p>you've clicked the button <span id="clicks">0</span> times</p>
```

```js
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
  let clickElement = document.getElementById("clicks");
  let currentClicks = Number(clickElement.innerHTML);
  clickElement.innerHTML = currentClicks + 1;
});
```

Let's open this up in our web browser and take a peek at what's going on.
Let's focus in a little bit on this: `document.getElementById(...) ...`. If you're looking for a direct example of the DOM in JS, here it is: the literal `document` object! This is the native JavaScript representation of the current webpage.

Next, we call `getElementById()` on it, with argument `"button"`. This should be pretty self explanatory as to what it does, but let's take a look at what it actually looks like in our console:

This is the crux of the DOM. Every tag in our document is representable as an object in native JavaScript (notice the properties `classList` or `attributes`?). We call each of these tags a **node** on our page. Why a node?

Going back to the tree structure of HTML documents we discussed in lesson 1, we can see where this is useful in JavaScript. Every tag is a **node** on our webpage, with a parent node and children nodes - notice the inclusion of the `children` field.

Each node also has a variety of member functions that can be called. In our example, we call `addEventListener`.

### `addEventListener`

This is an absolutely essential function to working with the DOM. If we want a particular function to be called each time an event occurs on the webpage with respect to a certain portion of said document, we can do so with this function.

To put the function in more definite types, its signature is a little something like: `addEventListener(string eventName, function callBack)`.

That is, we specify the event to listen for (in our case `"click"`), and the function to call when said event happens.

With that out of the way, let's talk about our callback function:

```js
function(){
    let clickElement = document.getElementById("clicks");
    let currentClicks = Number(clickElement.innerHTML);
    clickElement.innerHTML = currentClicks + 1;
})
```

We declare a variable to be the element on our page with ID "clicks", cast the contents of its HTML (the `.innerHTML` field) to a `Number`, then set its `.innerHTML` field to said number + 1. That is, it increments the numerical value of the innerHTML of `clicks`.

## Some Other Quirks

### Optional Semicolons

**Javascript has optional semicolons**. That means that a function like:

```js
function myFunc() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}
```

Is just as valid as:

```js
function myFunc() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}
```
