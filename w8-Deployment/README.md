## What is Deploying?
* So far, we have only developed sites that we can only access (using Localhost or React). We want to figure out a way where anybody who goes to a given URL can see our webpages that we have made.

# 1st Step: Creating a repo
* In Github, create a repo with the name of yourUserName.github.io

# 2nd step, Clone the repo
# 3rd step, Add an index.html file
* You will need an index.html in the root folder so that the service knows where to look 
* Commit this file and go to yourUserName.github.io
* Changes are real time!
