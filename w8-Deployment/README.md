## What is Deploying?

- So far, we have only developed sites that we can only access (using Localhost or React). We want to figure out a way where anybody who goes to a given URL can see our webpages that we have made.

# 1st Step: Creating a repo

- In Github, create a repo with the name of yourUserName.github.io

# 2nd Step

- Clone the repo

# 3rd Step

- You will need an index.html in the root folder so that the service knows where to look
- Commit this file and go to yourUserName.github.io
- Changes are real time!

# 4th Step

- Navigate to settings and select "Pages" here you will choose the branch in which your project is in and deploy

# Resources

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

# Project Development

## Getting Started

- Define a problem
- Are you interested in a certain technology, if so what can you do with it?
- Is it a project that would look good for a job?

## Planning

PLAN PLAN PLAN!!!!!!!!
Try to plan out your entire project using a project board as such

`Trellohttps://trello.com â€º en-US`

## Executing

Complete Tasks at a steady rate, working on projects in marathons is a bad idea
