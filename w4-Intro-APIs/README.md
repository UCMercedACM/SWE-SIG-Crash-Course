## What is an API ?

API stand for "Application programming interface" or as google would say "An application programming interface is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software".

Think of API's as a way to get information someone else has created and using it within your own project.

Here are some examples of API's `https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis`
Look through this and start to get a good idea of how API's can be tethered towards your own projects.
